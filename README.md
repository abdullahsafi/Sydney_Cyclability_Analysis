Aim :mag_right:
----------------
To calculate a cyclability score for different neighbourhoods in Sydney. 

**What is a Cyclability score?**

Its a score that we define to assess how well a neighbourhood caters to cyclists. 

To calculate cyclability per neighbourhood, a formula was used that took all data sources with relevance to cyclability into consideration. The formula is as follows:

cyclability = z(population density)+ z(dwelling density)+ z(service balance)+ z(bikepod density)+ z(BikeParking)

Where z is z-score or "standard score" which can be calculated using z = (x-Œº)/œÉ

Introduction
-------------
Establishing if working in organised teams can significantly influence performance on peerwise will be beneficial to both teachers and students. Results have shown that academic improvement is especially pronounced within relatively small cohorts and can even boost student performance. In addition to this student performance and engagement is of great interest and importance to educators like Gareth Denyer, a Professor here at the University of Sydney.

- Here you can access the Product Notebook and other folders.
- The Product Notebook can be opened through Google Colab (recommened):
   - Ensure you upload your copy of the repo onto your google drive
   - There is a path variable for you to link the data
- The Product Notebook can be opened through Jupyter Notebooks:
   - Ensure that modules and dependancies are downloaded

Data Origin and Summary :floppy_disk:
------------

**Origin of data**

Gareth Denyer has made extensive use of PeerWise in large classes at Sydney University. He has a set of de-identified data for students who worked in groups which he has classified in terms of their motivation and achievement levels. The data available is from internal PeerWise logs and final exams. Gareth has agreed to be available to discuss this topic with groups taking it on. Students who want to do this project need to be linked to the ethics processes for analysing this data.
