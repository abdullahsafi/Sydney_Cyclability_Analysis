Aim :mag_right:
----------------
To calculate a cyclability score for different neighbourhoods in Sydney. 

**What is a Cyclability score?**

Its a score that we define to assess how well a neighbourhood caters to cyclists. 

To calculate cyclability per neighbourhood, a formula was used that took all data sources with relevance to cyclability into consideration. The formula is as follows:

cyclability = z(population density)+ z(dwelling density)+ z(service balance)+ z(bikepod density)+ z(BikeParking)

Where z is z-score or "standard score" of a measure, which can be calculated using z(measure, x) = x ‚àí avg measure / stddev measure

Getting Started :file_folder:
--------------
**Short list of intructions for new collaborators to get up and running with the project.**

List of commands:

- `$ git clone https://github.com/abdullahsafi/Sydney_Cyclability_Analysis.git`
- `$ cd Sydney_Cyclability_Analysis`
- Here you can access the Source Code and Report in Jupter Notebooks.
- The Product Notebook can be opened through Google Colab:
   - Ensure you upload your copy of the repo onto your google drive
   - There is a path variable for you to link the data
- The Product Notebook can be opened through Jupyter Notebooks (recommened):
   - Ensure that modules and dependancies are downloaded

Data Origin and Summary :floppy_disk:
------------

**Origin of data**

Several CSV files with Statistical Area 2 (SA2) data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), as well as some car-sharing data from Sydney.
